Hello. I am Bilal Kaya, a third-year Software Engineering student at Beykoz University, studying on a full scholarship. With skills in C++, C#, Python, OOP, and web development frameworks like Django, I have built several projects, including a Bakery-Cafe Management System and a Fitness Center Management System. I am also proficient in developing RESTful APIs and working with SQL databases. Recently, I participated in the Rise In Stack Bootcamp, where I deepened my knowledge of modern technologies and blockchain development. My goal is to build innovative, impactful solutions in the tech industry.
