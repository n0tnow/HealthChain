Hello. I am Bilal Kaya, a third-year Software Engineering student at Beykoz University, studying on a full scholarship. With skills in C++, C#, Python, OOP, and web development frameworks like Django, I have built several projects, including a Bakery-Cafe Management System and a Fitness Center Management System. I am also proficient in developing RESTful APIs and working with SQL databases. Recently, I participated in the Rise In Stack Bootcamp, where I deepened my knowledge of modern technologies and blockchain development. My goal is to build innovative, impactful solutions in the tech industry.

## Project Description
HealthChain is a decentralized application designed to revolutionize healthcare management by offering a blockchain-based system for storing, accessing, and sharing medical records. Built on the Andromeda Protocol, it ensures patient privacy, seamless collaboration between healthcare providers, and streamlined access to critical information.

## Key Features
NFT-Based Records: Each medical record is minted as a CW721 NFT.
Access Control: Whitelist/blacklist management for authorized data sharing.
Token Economy: MEDAC tokens for secure record access and management.
Smart Contract Integration: Leverages ADOs for enhanced functionality.

## Vision
HealthChain aims to transform healthcare management by providing a secure, decentralized platform for storing and sharing medical records. Built on the Andromeda Protocol, it empowers patients with full control over their health data, ensuring privacy and transparency. HealthChain bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, enabling seamless collaboration and improving the efficiency of medical services. By leveraging blockchain technology, it reduces administrative burdens, enhances data security, and fosters trust. HealthChain has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry, making healthcare more accessible, efficient, and patient-focused while setting new standards for data management and privacy.


## Software Development Plan for HealthChain

1. Define Project Scope and Architecture

Outline the key features of HealthChain (NFT-based records, access control, token economy).
Design the system architecture using Andromeda Protocolâ€™s ADO framework.
Identify required ADO components:
CW721: For minting medical records as NFTs.
Address-List: For whitelist/blacklist access control.
CW20: For MEDAC token integration.
Auction: For record access management.
CW20-Exchange: For token exchange functionality.

2. Develop Smart Contracts with ADOs

Implement CW721 smart contracts for medical record creation.
Configure Address-List ADO for access management.
Integrate CW20 contracts for MEDAC tokens and define tokenomics.
Build auction and exchange ADOs for managing access and token utility.
Test smart contracts in an Andromeda testnet environment.

3. Establish Access and Data Control Mechanisms

Implement role-based access control (e.g., patients, healthcare providers).
Add granular privacy controls for record sharing and expiration.
Ensure emergency access protocols are implemented using smart contracts.

4. Front-End Development

Create a responsive web interface using React.js for interacting with the blockchain:
Medical record management (view, share, revoke access).
Token economy interface (balance, transactions, exchange).
Notifications for access requests and updates.
Implement Andromeda Protocol APIs for seamless backend integration.

5. Test and Refine

Perform unit testing on smart contracts and end-to-end testing on the dApp.
Collect feedback from beta testers and address usability or functionality issues.
Conduct security audits to ensure data integrity and privacy.

6. Deploy on Andromeda Mainnet

Finalize contracts and configurations for mainnet deployment.
Deploy the dApp and provide deployment URLs for NFT medical records and token exchange systems.
Share documentation for users and administrators.
